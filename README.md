This is a project for a database class as part of my ciriculum for my cybersecurity degree. This project is not meant to be completely secure or verify every attack vector to prevent data manipulation,
but moreso to demonstrate skills needed to interact, manipulate, and demonstrate control of databases and front-end access. Please keep this in mind when encountering bugs or other possible vulnerabilities.

DISCRETIONARY STATEMENT -- All code was written by me but was thrown into Google Gemini to neatly organize the code for readability sake. Do not interpret the comments as my own, but understand the code IS mine.


Project requires the following programs:
- Node.js (install first and restart system)   Download Link: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- MAMP (This is for the SQL server)   Download Link: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
- MySQL Workbench (Enter the SQL code provided in this project for it to work)   Download Link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
- Visual Studio Code (In case the code needs to be edited)   Download Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

HOW TO START THE SITE:
----------------------------
INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
----------
- open a command prompt (cmd)
- use cd until you get to ../car-rental-app
- type "npm install"

- open another command prompt (cmd)
- use cd until you get to ../car-rental-app/server
- type "npm install"

FRONT-END:
----------
- open a command prompt (cmd)
- use cd until you get to ../car-rental-app
- type "npm run dev" to start the front-end OR "code ." to open the current project in VS Code

BACK-END:
----------
- open another command prompt (cmd)
- use cd until you get to ../car-rental-app/server
- type "node index.js" to start the back-end


How To Get To The Site:
- The front-end should provide a local address such as: http://localhost:4321/
- Enter that into the search bar of your preferred browswer and hit enter
- It should load the front-end web page
